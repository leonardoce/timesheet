# Timesheet

I use this simple Python script to download data from
[Jira](https://jira.atlassian.com/) and
[Clockwork](https://www.herocoders.com/apps/clockwork-automated-timesheets-free)
and put them in local SQLite database.

The database can be used for reporting and statistics. Sometimes it's really
surprising to know on which project you really put your effort.


## Setup

You need to copy `timesheet.ini.template` to `timesheet.ini` and fill in the
details:

- `jira account id` can be discovered by clicking on your profile on the Jira 
	sidebar and by looking at the last URL component (i.e.
	https://********.atlassian.net/people/5bb7ad0ccc53fd0760103780, look at [1])

- `jira account name` is in the same profile page and usually correspond to
	your email

- `jira token` need to be set looking at the instructions at [2]

- `clockwork for jira token` can be created looking at the instructions at [3]
	
- `endpoint` is the URL where your Jira instance is hosted	


## How to download the existing data

This will synchronize the latest 30 days

```
./timesheet.py sync --horizon=30
```

## How to extract your timesheet

```
./timesheet.py latest --horizon=7
```
